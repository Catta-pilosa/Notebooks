# Notebooks
Here you can find some notes on some pure math topics.

1. Note on the course MATH5251(L1) Algebraic Geometry. The textbook is GTM52, Hartshorne's book. The link is https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/zshiah_connect_ust_hk/EZhdu63TRcRDr61jNfpEnMEBANbYsf1MzQEuXoAtjMkeTQ?e=B8mqct.
In this note you can find explanations on some points skipped by the author, and solutions to part of the excercise from section 1.1 to section 2.5.

2. Note on the topic of toric varities. The reference is William Fulton's 'Introduction to Toric Varieties'. This note contains section 3.1 and 3.2 of this book, which talks about the orbits of a toric varirty with torus action and fundamental group of toric vatieties. Another reference is Oda's book 'Convex Bodies and Algebraic Geometry: An introduction to the Theory of Toric Varieties'.
